# Employee Database Analysis

## Objective
This challenge involved modeling and importing internal company employee data so that the mass of information could then be more quickly analyzed.

## Data Modeling
Before analyzing the information, I created an ERD via [quickdatabasediagrams.com](quickdatabasediagrams.com) to display what information was shared between the six CSV files provided.

## Data Engineering
Through PgAdmin I created a schema for the six CSV files, a table for each file specifying the primary and foreign keys, and I also imported the cooresponding data for each table. 

## Data Analysis & Findings
To analyze the data, SQL quiries such as joining tables were used to answer questions. All findings can be found in the [EmployeesSQL file](https://github.com/ohigithub/sql-challenge/tree/main/EmployeeSQL).
