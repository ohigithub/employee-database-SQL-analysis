# sql-challenge

# Objective
This challenge involved modeling and importing internal company employee data so that the mass of information could then be more quickly analyzed.

# Data Modeling
Before analyzing the information, I created an ERD via quickdatabasediagrams.com to display what information was shared between the six CSV files provided.

# Data Engineering
Through PgAdmin I created a schema for the six CSV files, a table for each file specifying the primary and foreign keys, and I also imported the cooresponding data for each table. 

# Data Analysis & Findings
To analyze the data, SQL quiries such as joining tables were used to answer questions. All findings can be found in the Employees file.
